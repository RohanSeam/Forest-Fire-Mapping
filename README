Collaborated with a University of Washington Tacoma professor in order to derive a new multi-agent UAV control algorithm to explore and map a forest fire scenario. Demonstrated the effectiveness of this new algorithm by comparing to pre-existing algorithms to use as a baseline. These findings are assembled into a conference paper submitted to the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Conference.
